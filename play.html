        SCENE: _The sitting-room at the_ OLLIVANTS' _in a small town
        up-State. It is an evening late in the spring._<br>
   
        _A simple room is disclosed, bearing the traces of another
        generation. Old-fashioned window-doors at the right, overlooking
        the garden, open on a porch; another door in back opening on the
        hall-way. A large fire-place at the left, now concealed by an
        embroidered screen; the horsehair furniture, several terra-cotta
        statuettes, and a woodcut or two on the walls create the subtle
        atmosphere of the past. There is a lamp on the table, and another
        on a bracket by the door in back. Moonlight filters through the
        window-doors._
   
        _The_ OLLIVANTS _are discovered together_. MARY, _a rather plain
        woman of about twenty-five, with a suggestion of quick
        sensibilities, is standing, lost in thought, looking out into the
        garden. Her mother_, EMILY, _nearing fifty, quiet and subdued in
        manner, is seated at the table trimming a hat. Occasionally she
        looks at_ MARY, _stops her work, glances at her husband, closes her
        eyes as though tired, and then resumes. The silence continues for
        some time, broken only by the rattle of the town paper which_
        GEORGE OLLIVANT _is reading. He is well on in middle life, with a
        strong, determined face not entirely without elements of kindness
        and deep feeling. When he finishes, he folds the paper, puts it on
        the table, knocks the ashes carefully from his pipe into his hand,
        and throws them behind the screen; takes off his spectacles and
        wipes them as he, too, looks over toward his daughter, still gazing
        absently into the garden. Finally, after a slight hesitation, he
        goes to her and puts his arm about her; she is startled but smiles
        sweetly._
   
   OLLIVANT. [_Affectionately._] Glad to be home again, Mary?
   
   MARY. [_Evasively._] The garden is so pretty.
   
   OLLIVANT. Hasn't changed much, eh?
   
   MARY. It seems different; perhaps it's the night.
   
   OLLIVANT. I guess it isn't up to its usual standard. Haven't seen your
   mother there so often this spring.
   
   EMILY. [_Quietly._] This dry spell is not good for flowers.
   
   OLLIVANT. It's only the cultivated flowers that need care; can't help
   thinking that when I see the wild ones so hardy in my fields on the
   hill. [_Turning to_ EMILY _and patting her_.] Is there any of that spray
   mixture left, Emily, dear?
   
   EMILY. I haven't looked lately.
